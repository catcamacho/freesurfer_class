# Welcome to the Mood Lab FreeSurfer Class!
This course aims to provide an overview of the FreeSurfer recon-all pipeline for T1w MRI processing. By the end of the 5-day course, users will hopefully be able to tackle common errors that typically arise from running adolescent samples and confidently use FreeSurfer tools and outputs for their own analyses. <br>

This repository has several parts: <br>
1. Class Syllabus: In the main folder you'll find this document with a summary of what to expect from the class as well as out schedule for Winter 2017. <br>
2. Class Slides: After each Monday class I'll upload the slides from that week.  Be sure to review them for reinforcement! <br>
3. Class Bin: Quick scripts and functions that I have written to make it easier to manually adjust the freesurfer recon-all pipeline.<br>
4. Extracting Data: MATLAB functions I've written to extract data from an entire project and export it into CSVs for analysis in SPSS, MATLAB, or any other statistics program.<br>
5. Practice Brains: These are brain images kindly donated by members of the lab to enable your learning. Please feel free to use these files to practice using FreeSurfer.
